# hanoi_tower

Simple hanoi tower game. Press keys from 1-3 to select from which stick take the ring, press any key from 1-3 again to move the ring on the corepsonding stick.
There are simple move animations. Some silly shader as well, so objects are colorfull.
There is built in auto solver binded to 'A'. This project isn't fully finished, because lack of time, so solver only works when activated before player made any moves.
